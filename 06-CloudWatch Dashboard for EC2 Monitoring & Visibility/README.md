# 📊 CloudWatch Dashboard for EC2 Monitoring & Visibility

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Designed and implemented an **Amazon CloudWatch Dashboard** to monitor **EC2 instance performance metrics** in real time.

This assignment demonstrates how centralized monitoring helps organizations **identify performance issues, misconfigurations, and abnormal behavior** across cloud resources created by multiple users.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Amazon EC2**
- **Amazon CloudWatch**
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**
- **Performance Metrics**
  - CPU Utilization
  - Network In
  - Network Out

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To create a monitoring solution that:

- Provides **real-time visibility** into EC2 instance performance
- Helps identify **resource bottlenecks and anomalies**
- Enables proactive monitoring of machines created by different users
- Improves operational awareness and troubleshooting capability

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **EC2 Instance Selection**

- Selected a running **EC2 instance**
- Identified key performance metrics to monitor
- Ensured instance metrics were available in CloudWatch

---

### 2️⃣ **CloudWatch Dashboard Creation**

- Created a **custom CloudWatch Dashboard**
- Added widgets to visualize:
  - **CPU Utilization**
  - **Network In**
  - **Network Out**
- Configured widgets to monitor a specific EC2 instance

---

### 3️⃣ **Metrics Visualization & Validation**

- Verified real-time CPU usage trends
- Monitored network traffic patterns
- Confirmed dashboard updates dynamically with instance activity

---

## 🔐 **Security & Monitoring Configuration**

- Used CloudWatch’s **read-only monitoring capability**
- Avoided any configuration changes to EC2 instances
- Centralized monitoring without granting unnecessary permissions
- Enabled visibility without impacting workloads

---

## 📈 **Key Learning Outcomes**

- CloudWatch metrics understanding
- EC2 performance monitoring
- Dashboard creation and customization
- Interpreting CPU and network utilization trends
- Proactive monitoring and troubleshooting
