# 🗄️ Amazon S3 Bucket Creation & Object Storage

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Designed and implemented an **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** solution to provide **scalable object storage** for XYZ Corporation’s application.

This assignment demonstrates how S3 can be used to **store files securely**, manage different file types, and **enable public access when required**, making it suitable for modern cloud-native applications.

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Amazon S3**
- **S3 Bucket**
- **S3 Objects**
- **Public Access Configuration**
- **Object Storage Architecture**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To implement an object storage solution that:

- Stores application files securely
- Supports multiple file types
- Allows public sharing of objects when required
- Scales automatically without infrastructure management

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **S3 Bucket Creation**

- Created a new **Amazon S3 bucket**
- Selected appropriate region
- Ensured globally unique bucket name
- Configured default bucket settings

---

### 2️⃣ **Object Upload**

- Uploaded **5 objects** into the S3 bucket
- Used different file extensions such as:
  - `.txt`
  - `.jpg / .png`
  - `.pdf`
  - `.csv`
  - `.zip`
- Verified successful object upload in S3 console

---

### 3️⃣ **Access Validation**

- Confirmed objects are stored successfully
- Verified object metadata and file types
- Tested public access configuration (if enabled)

---

## 🔐 **Security Configuration**

- Controlled public access at bucket and object level
- Followed **least privilege access principles**
- Used S3 access controls to prevent unauthorized exposure
- Ensured secure storage by default

---

## 📈 **Key Learning Outcomes**

- Amazon S3 bucket creation
- Object storage concepts
- Handling multiple file types in S3
- Public vs private access management
- Scalable and durable cloud storage
- AWS storage best practices

---

## 🏆 **Real-World Use Case**

Amazon S3 is widely used for:

- Static website hosting
- Media and image storage
