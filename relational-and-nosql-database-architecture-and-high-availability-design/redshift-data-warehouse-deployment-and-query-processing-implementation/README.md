# 🏢 Redshift Data Warehouse Deployment and Analytics Query Validation

## 📌 Project Overview

An enterprise-grade data warehousing solution was implemented using Amazon Redshift to support analytical workloads and structured data processing.

The objective was to provision a Redshift cluster, load structured data into the warehouse, and validate analytical querying using the built-in Query Editor.

This implementation demonstrates large-scale data warehousing architecture, SQL-based analytics processing, and cloud-native data ingestion validation.
