# 🖥 On-Premise Ubuntu VM Provisioning for Cloud Migration Preparation

## 📌 Project Overview

As part of the cloud migration strategy, an on-premise Ubuntu server virtual machine was provisioned to simulate an existing infrastructure environment.

The objective was to create a local Ubuntu Server VM using Oracle VirtualBox, which would later be migrated to AWS Cloud as part of the infrastructure modernization process.

This implementation demonstrates hybrid migration preparation, virtualization fundamentals, and infrastructure transition readiness.
