# 🗂️ S3 Bucket Provisioning and Object Upload Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview

A scalable object storage solution was implemented using Amazon S3 to store and manage application files.

The objective was to provision an S3 bucket and upload multiple objects with different file extensions, demonstrating storage flexibility and public sharing capability where required.

This implementation highlights AWS object storage fundamentals, file management, and cloud-based storage architecture.
