# 🚀 Capstone Projects – Cloud & DevOps Engineering

---

## 📌 **Overview**

This folder contains **end-to-end capstone projects** showcasing my hands-on experience in **Cloud and DevOps engineering** using AWS.

Unlike individual assignments, these capstone projects are designed to **simulate real-world production scenarios**, focusing on architecture design, scalability, security, automation, and operational best practices.

Each project demonstrates my ability to **design, deploy, and manage cloud-native solutions** from scratch.
