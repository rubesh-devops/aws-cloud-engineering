# 🔐 Identity & Access Governance with Cloud Monitoring Implementation

---

## 📌 Module Overview

This module focuses on designing and implementing secure identity governance and monitoring architecture in AWS using:

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- IAM Users, Groups, Policies & Roles
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards
- CloudWatch Alarms & Billing Monitoring
- SNS-based Alerting

The objective was to implement enterprise-grade access control mechanisms and proactive infrastructure monitoring.
