# 📊 EC2 Performance Monitoring Architecture using Amazon CloudWatch

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Designed and implemented a **real-time monitoring dashboard** using **Amazon CloudWatch** to track critical performance metrics of EC2 instances.

The objective was to enable centralized visibility into system health, detect anomalies early, and improve operational governance across infrastructure resources.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

XYZ Corporation required:

- Centralized monitoring of EC2 instances
- Visibility into CPU performance trends
- Network traffic analysis for anomaly detection
- Dashboard-based operational oversight

This implementation ensures improved **infrastructure observability and proactive monitoring**.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Components

- **Amazon EC2**
- **Amazon CloudWatch Metrics**
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**
- **AWS Monitoring & Logging Layer**

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Summary

### 1️⃣ EC2 Instance Identification
- Selected a target EC2 instance for monitoring
- Verified default CloudWatch metrics were enabled

---

### 2️⃣ CloudWatch Metrics Configuration
Configured dashboard widgets for:

- **CPUUtilization**
- **NetworkIn**
- **NetworkOut**

Metrics were collected in near real-time and visualized through CloudWatch.

---

### 3️⃣ Dashboard Creation

Created a custom CloudWatch dashboard including:

- 📈 CPU Utilization graph
- 🌐 Network Inbound traffic graph
- 🌐 Network Outbound traffic graph

Configured appropriate time intervals and visualization types for accurate performance analysis.
