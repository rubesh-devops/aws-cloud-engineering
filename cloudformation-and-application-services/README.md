# ☁️ CloudFormation & Application Services – Infrastructure as Code & App Deployment

## 📌 Module Overview

This module focuses on automating infrastructure provisioning and deploying applications using AWS managed services.

Instead of manually configuring resources, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) was implemented using AWS CloudFormation to ensure:

- Repeatable deployments
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Scalable application environments
- Reduced human error

This module demonstrates production-ready infrastructure automation practices.
