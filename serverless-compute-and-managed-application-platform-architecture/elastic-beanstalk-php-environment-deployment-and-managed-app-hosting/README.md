# 🌿 Elastic Beanstalk PHP Application Deployment and Managed Platform Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview

A fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution was implemented using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy a PHP-based web application without managing underlying infrastructure.

The objective was to create a PHP runtime environment and deploy a simple PHP application, enabling automated provisioning, scaling, and infrastructure management handled entirely by AWS.

This implementation demonstrates managed application deployment, environment configuration, and simplified DevOps workflow using Elastic Beanstalk.

## ⚙️ Implementation Summary

### 1️⃣ Elastic Beanstalk Environment Creation

- Selected PHP as platform runtime  
- Configured environment type (Single Instance / Load Balanced)  
- Defined application name  
- Selected instance type  
- Configured environment settings  

---

### 2️⃣ Application Deployment
