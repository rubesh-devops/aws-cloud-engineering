# 🚀 Managed Web Application Deployment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk (PHP)

## 📌 Project Overview

Implemented a **fully managed web application deployment** using AWS Elastic Beanstalk with PHP runtime to eliminate manual infrastructure management.

This solution enables automatic provisioning, scaling, health monitoring, and environment management without directly managing EC2 instances.

## 🎯 Business Requirement

XYZ Corporation required:

- A web-based PHP application deployment
- No manual server provisioning
- Fully managed AWS service
- Automatic environment setup and monitoring
- Scalable and production-ready architecture
