# ⚡ Serverless & Managed Application Services on AWS

## 📌 Module Overview

This module demonstrates the implementation of modern cloud-native architectures using:

- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- AWS OpsWorks

The focus is on reducing operational overhead by leveraging managed services and serverless compute to deploy scalable, event-driven and application-centric architectures.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

Enable rapid application deployment while:

- Eliminating server management complexity
- Reducing infrastructure provisioning time
- Improving scalability and elasticity
- Supporting event-driven architectures
- Enabling automated application lifecycle management

---

## 🧩 Services Covered

### ⚡ AWS Lambda
- Serverless compute service
- Executes code without provisioning servers
- Event-driven architecture support
- Auto-scaling based on invocation

---

### 🌐 Amazon API Gateway
- Fully managed API service
- Exposes Lambda functions as REST endpoints
- Handles request routing and throttling
- Enables secure API access

---

### 🚀 AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Deploy web applications without infrastructure management
- Handles scaling, load balancing, monitoring automatically

---

### 🛠 AWS OpsWorks
- Configuration management service
- Automates application deployment using Chef & Puppet
- Suitable for complex lifecycle orchestration

---
