# 🌱 AWS Elastic Beanstalk – Managed PHP Application Deployment

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Designed and deployed a **fully managed web application environment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk** to support XYZ Corporation’s requirement for a **server-managed, scalable web application platform**.

This assignment demonstrates how **Elastic Beanstalk abstracts infrastructure management**, allowing teams to focus on application development while AWS handles provisioning, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- **PHP Runtime Environment**
- **Amazon EC2 (Managed by Beanstalk)**
- **Elastic Load Balancer**
- **Auto Scaling**
- **AWS Managed Platform Services**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To implement an application deployment solution that:

- Eliminates the need for manual server management
- Uses **AWS-managed application hosting**
- Supports rapid deployment of PHP applications
- Automatically handles scaling, health monitoring, and updates
- Reduces operational overhead for development teams

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Elastic Beanstalk Environment Creation**

- Created an **Elastic Beanstalk application**
- Selected **PHP runtime platform**
- Deployed a new **Elastic Beanstalk environment**
- Verified environment health status as **Green**
- Confirmed AWS-managed resources were provisioned automatically

---

### 2️⃣ **PHP Application Deployment**

- Created a **simple PHP application file**
- Uploaded the PHP file to the Elastic Beanstalk environment
- Deployed application successfully
- Verified application accessibility via Beanstalk environment URL

---

### 3️⃣ **Application Validation**

- Accessed application using the public endpoint
- Confirmed PHP code execution
- Verified environment stability and responsiveness

---

## 🔐 **Security & Managed Configuration**

- Used AWS-managed EC2 instances and load balancer
- Avoided direct server configuration and maintenance
- Relied on Elastic Beanstalk for:
  - Health monitoring
  - Auto scaling
  - Platform updates
- Reduced risk of misconfiguration

---
